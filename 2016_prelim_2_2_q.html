        <p style ="text-align: relative"> 
        In web serivces or online games, there are often automated programs so that the computers can do the work instead of humans. <br>

        This happens without the intention of the developer, so there are regulations placed or even tests that asks whether you are a robot or a human. For example, CAPTCHA is one of them. <br>

       In order to really determine whether the user is a robot or a human, the problems need to be something that is hard for robots to solve but easy for humans. If this is not done well, it could produce the opposite effect which is what would want the least. <br>

        
        Louis, after creating the most recent blog, he wants to develop a program that detects spam bots so that they won't leave useless comments on his blog. The system Louis wants to develop is that given an image with two circles, whether they are able to accurately click on the two circles. The images will always be the size of 100 pixel by 100 pixel, and the two black circles in the image will not be overlapped. For example, the following image is an example. <br>

        </p>

        
<center> <img src="images/2016_prelim_2_2_1.png"> </center>

        <p style="text-align: relative">
        However, thinking a little more about this, this problem isn't so hard for robots to solve. <br>

        Angered by the poor detective system Louis created, Marie decided to create a robot program that will accurately detect two circles in the image. If this program could detect the two circles' centers and radii, then Louis would be so embarrassed. <br>

        So, let us help Marie develop such program.
        </p>
        


        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p style ="text-align: relative">
         In 100 lines, each line has 100 characters and each character being either 0 or 1. 0 or 1 represents the pixel's color. 1 is black, and 0 is white. <br>

         The image contains two full circles that have radii greater than or equal to 15 with no overlap. The center and the radius of the circle is always an integer.<br>

         The algorithm mentioned below is not required in solving this problem, but if interested, take a look at "Algorithm to color the circle". <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p style ="text-align: relative">
        Output the first circle and second circle's x-coordinate and y-coordinate for the center and the radius of each circle in respective order. All results should be integers and the radius must be greater than or equal to 15. <br>

        The pixel grid is represented as the following: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The top left is (0, 0), the top right is (99, 0), bottom left is (0, 99), and the bottom right is (99, 99). <br>

        It doesn't matter which circle's information you output first. 
          <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Algorithm to color the circle</h2>
       

      

         <p style="text-align: relative">
         This is just for reference, so if you aren't interested, you do not have to read. <br>

         In order to draw a circle with center (p, q) and radius r, we use an algorithm called Midpoint circle algorithm. <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Into the midpoint circle algorithm, plug in x = r, y = 0, and err = 0. <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - For the case that x is greater than or equal to y, we repeat the following: <br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> Color all pixels from (p - x, q - y) to (p + x, q - y).<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> Color all pixels from (p - x, q + y) to (p + x, q + y).<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> Color all pixels from (p - y, q - x) to (p + y, q - x).<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> Color all pixels from (p - y, q + x) to (p + y, q + x).<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> Increment y by 1.<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> Increase err by 1 + 2 * y.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> If 2 * (err - x) + 1 is greater than 0, <br>

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> Decrement x by 1.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> Increase err by 1 - 2 * x.<br>
        </p><br>

        These are some example images the input will receive.

        <h2>Marks Guideline</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
        Marks will be awarded according to the number of hidden test cases the program passes.
