        <h1>Release the Squirrels!</h1>
        <p style ="text-align: relative">Long long time ago, in 1996, players of the game “Land of the Wind” used to say: “Release the squirrels!” 
        </p>
        <center> <img src="images/rs_img1.jpg"> </center>
        <p style="text-align: relative">If new squirrels were not released during hunting seasons when there were no squirrels left to hunt, players would say that message to rush Nexon to release more squirrels. </p>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
                In 2038, 42 years after the release of game “Land of the Wind”,  “주모 왈숙” decided to change the rules by introducing a new type of skill. </p>
        <p style ="text-align: relative">
                The new technology, DoD(DaramG on Demand), guaranteed that there wouldn’t be a situation where the squirrels are lacking, and in fact, it made sure that there were twice the amount of squirrels in comparison to the number of hunters on the hunting ground.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
                If given a game screen of size N by N and the number of squirrels in each section, write a program that determines if there needs to be more squirrels on the screen, 
                and outputs the locations where the new squirrels should be placed if needed.    
         </p>
        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p style ="text-align: relative">
            First line of input will have the size of the game screen, N. N is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 20. </p>
        <p style="text-align: relative">   
            In the next N lines of input, N characters will be given without any space in between.  </p>
        <p style="text-align: relative">    
                The character will be one of these three options: <br>
                -	D: There is a Squirrel in that area <br>
                -	C: There is a player in that area <br>
                -	. : The area is empty                
            </p>
       <h2>Output</h2>
       <p style="text-align: relative">
            Following the same instructions as used in the input, the first line of output should be the size N.  <br>
            Across the next N lines of output, the updated game screen information where each area is represented by either D, C, or . should be printed.
        </p>
       <p style="text-align: relative"> 
            New squirrels still use the same letter, D, and they can be placed anywhere as long as the number of squirrels is correct.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: relative">
            If there is no need for new squirrels to be released, then the same game board inputted should be printed. <br> 
            However, if there is a lack of squirrels, the number of squirrels in the resulting game board should be twice the number of players currently on the hunting ground.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: relative">
            Squirrels’ locations and players’ locations cannot overlap. <br>
            There will never be a case where new squirrels cannot be released if needed.
       </p>

       <h2>Input Example 1</h2>

       .....
       </pre>
       
       <p style="text-align: relative">
        If there are only squirrels present on the board, then the number of players is 0,
        so there is no lack of squirrels. <br>
        Therefore, do not relase more squirrels.   
        </p>
       <h2>Marks Guideline</h2>
       <p style="text-align: relative">Marks will be awarded according to the number of hidden test cases the program passes.</p>
