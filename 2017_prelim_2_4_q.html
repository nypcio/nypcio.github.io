        <h1>Frog Jump</h1>
       

        <p style ="text-align: relative"> 
        There is one frog near the lake, where N logs are floating. Out of all the logs, there is one destination log the frog wishes to go to. <br>
        Let us take the lake and its logs to a cartesian-coordinate plane. The frog will begin on the x-axis and it can jump up and down between the logs. Once the frog leaves the x-axis, the frog is only able to stand on a log. Logs are horizontally long and move toward the right. The sizes of the logs cannot be consistent, and the speed and the starting point of the movement of the log may vary. From (0, 1) until (0, N) logs are originally placed. The below figure shows the starting stage, in other words, the 0th second of how the frog and logs are placed. The one different colored log is the frog's destination log.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: relative"> 
        The amount a frog can jump is K. In other words, from the frog's current position, the frog can jump to logs with in +/- K amount. <br>
        In order for the frog's jump to be successful, at least one x-coordinate point has to overlap between the log the frog is currently standing and the log the frog will jump to. Thus, looking down, the 2 logs must have some overlap or their endpoints must match. The first jump the frog will make from the x-axis, can be from the original position of the frog to any log within the K distance. The frog can jump once every second (it may remain still). The frog can move to the side anytime. <br>
        Let's assume it takes 0 time for the frog to move side to side. In the 0th second, the frog cannot move. The next image shows the 1st second after the logs have moved.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: relative"> 
        Two logs have moved. If a log starts to move, it continues to move in its constant speed. Just think of this as that a log teleports every second. In this example, K = 4. So the frog can jump to any of the bottom 5 logs in this first second. The frog chose to jump to the 4th log. The next image shows the 2nd second. 
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: relative">
        3 more logs have begun to move. The frog now jumped to the 7th log as the end point of log 7 and the start point of log 4 were equal. In this stage, it is impossible for the frog to directly jump down to the destination log. The next shows the 3rd second.

        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
          The first line of input has a natural number N represents the number of logs, the y-coordinate natural number O that is the destination log, and the length K a frog can jump. (O is greather than equal to 1 and less than or equal to N and N is greater than equal to O and less than equal to 50,000. K should be greater than equal to 1 and less than or equal to 20.) <br>
          The next N lines will have the log's information in chronological order. Information includes the size of the log, its starting point, and the speed. These will be represented in three natural numbers with spaces in between. In this case, the values will not be greater than 10 <sup>6</sup>.
        </p>

       
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
        Ouput the earliest lovation the frog can arrive in natural numbers. If it is not possible for the frog to reach the destination log, return -1.
        </p>

        <h2>Marks Guideline</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
          The input cases have 3 types: To get points, you need to have correct outputs for all test cases for one type of input test cases. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Type 1 (50 marks): N is less than or equal to 8. <br>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Type 2 (100 marks): K = 1. <br>
             &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Type 3 (200 marks): No other restrictions other than the ones listed in the problem. <br>
