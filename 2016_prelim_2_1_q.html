        <h1>How much did you walk?</h1>
       

        <p style ="text-align: relative"> 
        To match the current trend of games, Joe wanted to develop a game that one could play while actually walking around. <br>

        In order to prevent users from driving in a car to increase their moving distance, Joe needs to figure out how to actually calculate the amount the user walked.<br>

        Given the time a certain movement was recorded and the distance in one day, develop a program that determines the distance that the user actually walked. <br>

        Here, we assume that the walking speed is between 3km and 5km inclusive. For speeds slower or faster than that range is not considered in the calculation. <br>

        </p>

        

        


        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p style ="text-align: relative">
          First line of input has the number of input data, N.
          The next N lines have the input data.
          Each line following the first line has 3 information: the time the movement started, finished time, and the distance travelled. <br>
          The times are given in a 24-hour system in hour:minute, and the distance is in meters. The distance is always a positive integer, and the speed never exceeds 1200km. (We exclude the situation when Joe takes a rocket or a plane.) <br>

          Arriving time and starting time can never be the same and there can never be overlap when one detects a movement. However, the end time of a movement and the start time of the next movement may be the same. The input will never have a situation where it goes over midnight so that it becomes a different day. <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p style ="text-align: relative">
        Output the total distance that Joe travelled in the average speed in between 3km and 5km. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Input Example 1</h2>
        <pre>
          3
          09:35 10:01 401
          10:11 10:30 1361
          10:30 10:34 297
          </pre>
        <h2>Output Example 1</h2>
        <pre>
        1658
        </pre>

      

         <p style="text-align: relative">
          The second and third movement was summed as the average speed was in between 3km and 5km. However, the first movement is 0.92km so it's not included. 
        </p>
       
        <h2>Marks Guideline</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
        Marks will be awarded according to the number of hidden test cases the program passes. 
        </p>
