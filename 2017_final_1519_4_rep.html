        <h1>Tetris</h1>
       

        <p style ="text-align: relative"> 
        Tetris pro, Bazzi, has a hobby of playing tetris with other characters and taking their snacks. The other characters decided to come together to beat Bazzi by creating a tetris macro. <br>

        <br>
        Tetris is a game made out of 4 grid blocks, filling a 20*10 grid plane. The rules are as follows: <br> 
        - At the start, the grid plane is empty. <br>
        - When the game begins, in a set order, one of the seven blocks fall from top to bottom. The block falls until it hits different block. <br>
        </p>
        <center> <img src="images/2017_final_1214_5.png"> </center>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
        - The player can move the destination location of the blocks and rotate the blocks. However, unlike other tetris games, you cannot do so while the block is falling. <br>
        - Blocks cannot leave the grid plane. If it does, the game ends. <br>
        - A row filled with blocks gets removed and the top blocks fall. <br>
        - You can use a function called "hold". If you "hold" a block, you can swap it with the falling block. At the start, the hold section is open, and once you hold a falling block, the next block becomes the falling block and the hold section is filled with the block you just held. <br>
        - You cannot use the "hold" function in a row. <br>
        - After making the final block fall, you cannot use the block in the hold section. <br>

        To win a tetris battle, you need to have a high combo score. <br>
        - At the start, you have a combo score of 0. <br>
        - Your combo increases by one if there is a line that is removed, otherwise your combo score is reset to 0. <br>

        <br>
        Let us create a program that tells us the way to get the max comobo score given the ordering of blocks.
        </p>

        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
      The first line of iput has the number of games, T where T is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10. For each game, the first line has the number of blocks, N, where 1 &le; N &le; 100. The second line has N block numbers that show us the order the blocks fall. The blocks are labelled 0 to 6 in the order of the image above. 
        </p>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
     For each test case, output the actions taken on each turn across N + max(0, (hold_count - 1)) lines. If you used the "hold" function, output H, otherwise, output the rotation number r, and the falling block's leftmost x-coordinate. (0 &le; r &le; 3, 0 &le; x &le; 9)
     The leftmost coordinate of the grid plane is 0, and the right most is 9. Block rotates by 90 degrees clockwise.  <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Input Example 1</h2>
        <pre>
1
7
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
        </pre>

        <h2>Output Example 1</h2>
<pre>

0 0
H
0 4
0 2
0 6
H
0 0
H
0 8
</pre>



  <p style="text-align: relative">
 The given input has 2 combos. On line 7, we deleted that line by block 1, and on line 9, we deleted that line by block 1 as well.
  </p>


      

        <h2>Marks Guideline</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
        We calculate each test case score as follows: <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - If you output something wrong, or you are unable to place your blocks in the middle of the game, you do not receive any marks. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - In the case the above scenario does not apply to you, for each test case you will receive: <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Score = (current_test_case_score) * (0.5 + 0.5 (T + 1)/(B + 1)) where: <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - T = Maximum combo of the test case. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - B = The maximum combo of any contestant for that test case. <br>

        Total score is the sum of all test cases. <br>
        </p>
