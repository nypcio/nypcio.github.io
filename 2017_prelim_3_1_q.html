        <h1>Blue Area</h1>
       

        <p style ="text-align: relative"> 
        On a white canvas (2-D), we draw and color in a square where the sides are parallel with the x and y axes of the 2-D coordinate system with blue markers. As a result, the frame and the inside of the square will be all colored blue. <br>

        N of these squares lie on a plane. Each square will be represented by its bottom left coordinate and the length of the square. In such a case, our goal is to write a program on how many of these blue areas can occur. <br> 

        Here, the connected blue area means that if arbitrary points a and b were selected, an ant can started at point a and get to point b by solely crossing the blue area (by at least one route). By using the fact that the sides of the square are parallel to the x and y axes, we can redefine the blue area P as: for two arbitrary points a and b in P, by connecting a and b and with lines parallel to the axes in the blue area gives us at least one route. <br>
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: relative"> 
       In the figure below, we see 3 square with 2 squares with side length 1 with the bottom left coordinates being (1, 1) and (2, 2). We also see one with side length 2 with the bottom left coordinate being (4, 1). <br>
       Let us label the left 2 squares A and B. A and B overlap at point (2, 2) and because the square area includes the frame, these 2 squares form one blue area. In other words, if we choose an arbitary point a in A and a point b in B, with a combination of lines parallel to the x and y axes, a path P can be made that connects point a and point b within that blue area. This path must pass (2, 2). In this diagram, we see that there are 2 connected blue areas.

        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
          The first line has the number N, which represents the number of squares and N can be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000. <br>
          Then, the next N lines have 3 values a, b, and L separated by a space. (0 &ge; a, b &le; 10<sup>9</sup>). a, b here represent the x and y coordinate of the bottom left coordinate of the square and L is the square's side length. Every square's coordinates are less than 10 <sup>9</sup>. 
        </p>

       
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
       Output the number of blue areas.

        <h2>Marks Guideline</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
          The input cases have 3 types: To get points, you need to have correct outputs for all test cases for one type of input test cases. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Type 1 (25 marks): N &le; 100, and all x and y coordinates of the points of the square should be less than or equal to 100. <br>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Type 2 (60 marks): N &le; 1000, and all x and y coordinates of the points of the square should be less than or equal to 1000. <br>
             &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Type 3 (35 marks): No other restrictions other than the ones listed in the problem. <br>
