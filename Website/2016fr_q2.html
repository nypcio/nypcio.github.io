        <h1>Arithmetic with Matches: Only One</h1>
        <p style ="text-align:center">
        An arithmetic equation is given in matches:
        </p>

        <p style ="text-align: center">For example, the above image says 5 – 7 + 3, and the result is 1.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center">Now, from the above arithmetic equation, if we move one match from 3, the result of the below equation becomes 0. </p>
        <img src="images/m1_img2.png">
        <p style="text-align: center">
                Just like the above example, let us move only one match to make the result of the arithmetic equation 0. 
                -	Each equation is made up with single-digit positive integers, +, and -.
                -	The numbers from 0 to 9 need to be represented as the following:                 
        </p>
        <img src="images/m1_img3.png">
        <p style ="text-align: center">In other words, you are not allowed to create numbers as the following:
        </p>
        <img src="images/m1_img4.png">
        <p style ="text-align: center">
                -	Newly made equation must only use a single digit positive integer, +, and -.
                -	Matches that make up any number (0 – 9) or symbols (+, -) can be moved to form other numbers or symbols. 
                ex) 0 + 1 can be changed into 8 – 1
                -	You are unable to change a number to a symbol and vice versa. 
                ex) + cannot be changed to 1.
                -	You cannot move a match to a place with nothing to form a number/symbol nor can you delete all matches to get rid of a number/symbol.
                ex) 111cannot be changed to 9.
                -	You may not add nor delete a match from the arithmetic equation. In other words, the total number of matches must be equal after the transformation.
                -	You cannot move more than 1 match.
                -	The original equation and resulting equation always begins with a single-digit positive integer, and no two symbols may be next to each other. 
                ex)  -1 + 10 nor 1 – - 1 is allowed.                 
        </p>
        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p style ="text-align: center">
            First line of input is the original arithmetic equation that will be represented in matches.
             The maximum length of the arithmetic equation is 100.
            </p>
       <h2>Output</h2>
       <p style="text-align: center">
            Output an arithmetic equation generated by moving one match from the input where the result is 0. There may be multiple possible solutions, but in such case, output only one.
       </p>
