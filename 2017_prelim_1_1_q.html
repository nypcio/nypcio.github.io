        <h1>Movement Distance of a Fly</h1>
       
        <!-- Add in Image here -->

        <p style ="text-align: relative"> Two trains are travelling on the same platform with respective constant speeds. A fly is flying between the trains and let us calculate the distance the fly flies until the two trains collide.
        </p>
        <p style ="text-align: relative"> 
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The fly flies with constant speed in the same direction until it hits something. <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Once the fly hits something while flying, it switches to the opposite direction and continues to fly until it hits something once again. <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- If the train isf aster than the fly and regardless of whether the train and the fly collied while travelling in the same or opposite direction, the fly attaches itself to the train and they move together.  
         <br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the case the fly and the train both have the same speed and they collide from travelling from different directions, from the point of collision, the fly attaches itself to the train and flies with the train.<br>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
          Inititially, <br>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Train A starts at position a travelling x m/s towards the right. <br>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Train B starts at position b travelling y m/s towards the left. <br>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fly starts at position 0 travelling z m/s towards the right. <br>
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: relative">
        If the position value is negative, it means the train is on the left of the fly, and if the position value is positive, the train is on the right of the fly. Thus, a is negative and b is positive. The trains never change their directions of travel.
        </p>


        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p style ="text-align: relative">
          First line of input has T, the number of cases included in the file. T must be an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive. <br>
          Each case's first line has two integers a and b. <br>
          Each case's second line has three integers x, y, z where x, y, and z must be integers between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. <br>
          x, y, z here represents the speed of train A, B, and the fly in m/s respectively.
        </p>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p style ="text-align: relative">
          For each case, output either 1, 2, or 3 on the first line. <br>
          Ouput 1 if: <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right before the collision of the two trains, the fly was travelling with train A.
          <br>
          Output 2 if: <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right before the collision of the two trains, the fly was travelling with train B.
          <br>
          Output 3 if: <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right before the collision of the two trains if the fly was travelling. (This includes the situation when the moment fly collided with the train is equal to the moment when the two trains collided.) <br>
          In the second line of output, output the distance the fly travelled. (If the error of your distance calculation is within 10<sup>-6</sup>, your answer is considered correct.)
        </p>
