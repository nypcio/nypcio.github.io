        <h1>Water Balloons</h1>
       

        <p style ="text-align: relative"> 
        In Crazy Arcade, the BnB character Dao needs to continuously move around to escape from water balloon atacks. The map Dao can move around is given in a H x W grid. There are L blocks that block the way of Dao. Our goal is to find the safe route for Dao to get from his starting point to his destination without getting hit by water balloons. Dao can move one step either top, bottom, left, or right starting from turn one. It is possible for him to not move. K water balloons are placed on each turn. It's not a problem for a water balloon to be placed on the spot where Dao is, but if a water balloon is placed on the space Dao wants to move to, he cannot go there. Even if a water balloon is placed where Dao is standing, he doesn't have to move. At each turn, water balloons placed more than or equal to 3 turns ago are popped. For example, when turn 2 happens and a water balloon is placed then, it is popped on turn 4. When a water balloon is popped, it spreads up/down/right/left to the distance based on the number of water balloons placed. If there is a block blocking the water balloon's water, then it doesn't go over the block. If one popped water balloon touches another water balloon that hasn't been popped yet, it makes that one pop as well. If Dao is standing in the way of the popped water balloon, then Dao gets trapped in the water balloon and won't be able to move. Let us write a program that calculates the minimum pathway for Dao to take to not get hit by a water balloon. Getting hit by a water balloon after arriving at the destination is considered a success. 
        </p>
<br>


        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
      The first line of input has the row number H, and column number W where 1 &le; H, W &le; 50. The second line has Dao's starting point Rs, Cs and destination point Re, Ce. This means that the starting row of Dao is Rs, and starting column is Cs, and so on. The starting point and destination point are always different. The third line has L,  the number of blocks that will be blocking Dao's way (0 &le; L &le; H * W). Across next L lines, we are given the location of blocks R, C. This means that the block is at R row, C column. All locations of the blocks are different. The next line has the number of water balloons, K (0 &le; K &le; 5000). The following K lines has the location of the water balloons in terms of R,C again, P, the strength of the water balloon, and T, the turn the water balloon is placed. (1 &le; P &le; 50, 1 &le; T &le; 5000). The water balloon information is given in increasing order of T. A water balloon cannot be placed no a block, and no two water balloons are placed at the same place. Only acceptable scenarios are in the input.
        </p>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
      On the first line, output T, the least number of turns Dao needs to take to get to the destination. In the next T lines, output the path Dao took. If it's the kth turn, output the location Dao should be at the end of turn k in row and column numbers.  <br>
        </p>

  <p style="text-align: relative">
  On the start of turn 2, the balloon placed on first row second column is popped at the end of turn 4, and it hits until row four second column, so Dao needs to move to row three column one.
  </p>


      

        <h2>Marks Guideline</h2>
        <p style="text-align: relative">
        The input cases have 2 types: To get points, you need to have correct outputs for all test cases for one type of input test cases. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Type 1 (19 marks): K = 0.<br>
          
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Type 2 (81 marks): No other restrictions other than the ones listed in the problem. <br>
